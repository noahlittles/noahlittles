		<h1><center>About Me, Noah Littles</center></h1>
		<font size="3" color="blue"><font face="verdana"><p class="dotted">I was born in Newark, New Jersey in the general hosptial. It wasn't anything special. I was born normally, in a normal hospital. My parents decided to move me here to Georgia to move away from the more rougher areas of Jersey they were living in. My sister was born in Georgia only after a tear she was born and like a lot of siblings, she was my best friend. I went to Eastside Elementary, Chapel Hill Middle School, and Chapel Hill High. I never had to move to new areas and change schools. In elementary school my dad was a teacher and everybody knew me. The teachers loved me and I had lots of friends, but then I went to Chapel Hill when all my friends went to Turner.</p><br>
		<p class="dotted">In middle school I made all my real friends, people I still talk to tooday and really trust. Its also where I decided to commit to band. I play Bassoon, Oboe, and Percussion. Im in the marching band and it means so much to me. When I grow up I want to become either a real estate agent or an aircraft welder. I'm still not 100% certin on what I'm going to do with my life though.</p></font><br></div>
